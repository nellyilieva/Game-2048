# Game-2048
"2048" is a single-player sliding puzzle game that challenges players to combine numbered tiles on a grid.
The goal is to reach the tile with the number 2048 by strategically sliding tiles in four directionsâ€”up, down, left, or right.
Every move causes a new tile (usually with a value of 2 or 4) to appear on the board.
Tiles with the same number merge when they collide, doubling their value.
